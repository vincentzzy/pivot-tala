Welcome to the open source repository of Project TALA, brought to you by [Team Pivot](https://teampivot.my.canva.site)!

**Project TALA**(an acronym for Technology for Adaptive Learning Adventures) is a web app designed with the student in first priority. With a model designed for maximum engagement, entertainment, and learning, we are making sure that education caters for the slow learners, learners with mental disorders, and people who cannot afford regular education.
